BTT AI Independent Project

A comparison on various ML models in analyzing sentiment of text data.
The dataset used is a subset of the ISEAR dataset and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faisalsanto007/isear-dataset).

The goals for this project are to:
1. Build a supervised sentiment analysis model.
2. Build an unsupervised sentiment analysis model.
3. Incorporate the unsupervised model into a web application.
